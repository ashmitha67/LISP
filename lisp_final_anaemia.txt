DIAGNOSE THE SUBTYPE OF ANAEMIA 

Problem Description :
		To find the subtype of anaemia the patient has incurred using PROLOG system.

Solution Description :
		Initially the confirmation is done if the patient has anaemia which is proceeded by a few set of questions which helps us determine the subtype of anaemia the patient has incurred.
